// Here's how to implement the Databricks Unity Catalog connection using the Fetch API instead of Axios:

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const DatabricksDataComponent = () => {
  const [catalogData, setCatalogData] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://your-databricks-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/unity-catalog/tables?catalog_name=your_catalog&schema_name=your_schema', {
          method: 'GET',
          headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.REACT_APP_DATABRICKS_TOKEN}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          }
        });
        
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        
        const data = await response.json();
        setCatalogData(data.tables);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading catalog data...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error fetching data: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <div className="catalog-container">
      <h2>Databricks Unity Catalog Data</h2>
      <div className="tables-list">
        {catalogData.map(table => (
          <div key={table.name} className="table-item">
            <h3>{table.name}</h3>
            <p>{table.comment || 'No description available'}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DatabricksDataComponent;

// How would would the structure be if I got the data using a Databricks Unity Catalog connection using the Fetch API

// ## Trae AI
// If you were to get the data using a Databricks Unity Catalog connection with the Fetch API, the structure would change from static JSON imports to dynamic API responses. Instead of importing and flattening JSON files, your App.tsx would make fetch calls to the Databricks API endpoints. The response structure would likely be similar to your current JSON files, but you'd need to transform the API response into the flattened structure your components expect. You'd replace the static imports and flattenTables function with useEffect hooks that fetch data from Databricks endpoints and process the responses. The LayerCatalog component would remain largely unchanged, but would receive data from state variables populated by API calls rather than static imports.

// where would you put that in this app?

// ## Trae AI
// Based on the project structure and requirements, I would integrate the Databricks Unity Catalog API connection in the App.tsx file. You would create a new component (like DatabricksDataComponent.tsx) in the components folder that handles the API connection and data fetching. This component would replace the current static JSON file imports and instead fetch data dynamically from Databricks. The BusinessUnitFilter would remain, but would filter data from the API response rather than static files. This approach maintains the existing UI structure while replacing the data source.

// what about pagination? what if it's a lot of data?

// ## Trae AI
// For handling large datasets in the React application, implementing pagination is essential. You could add pagination to the data catalog by: 1) Modifying the API call to accept page number and size parameters, 2) Implementing a Pagination component with next/previous buttons and page indicators, 3) Adding state management for the current page, 4) Only fetching and rendering data for the current page, and 5) Adding loading indicators during page transitions. This approach significantly reduces initial load time and memory usage since only a subset of data is loaded at once. For very large datasets (like your 100MB+ files), server-side pagination combined with client-side virtualization provides the best performance.
